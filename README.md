### Notes:
- Use [this site](https://lolshop.gg/) to look at the full item list

- Items with parenthesis are the unique keywords (meaning you cannot build two items with the same keywords)

- Mythic items will have their mythic passive stat next to them, each completed item minus the mythic itself  and boots
  will give that stat.

- Ability haste is the percent more spells that you can cast, 100 haste means you can cast your ability 100% more times, twice as much\
  65 haste ~~ 40cdr\
  100 haste ~~ 50cdr\
  15 haste ~~ 13cdr

- Suggest champions/specific items to review to me(Ethoe)

## Top:
### _Bruisers:_ 
   There are a lot of items that give pseduo lifesteal in that they dont have the stat lifesteal, but gives back a lot of hp through passives. A lot of health items not a lot of great items for resists.
   * **Trinity**(Mythic - 10 Attack Speed) - Gives spellblade and in champion combat base AD: Really good for champions that can utilize attack Speed
   * **Divine Sunderer**(Mythic - 5% armor + mr pen) - Spellblade passive that does %max hp dmg and heals you for a percent ofthat dmg: Insane item, the mythic passive gives both pen so champions like Jax can use it really well against tanks.
   * **Stride Breaker**(Mythic - 3% movespeed) - Active to dash a short distance for 110% ad dmg + 60% slow: Underwhelming item, the dash is really short and the mythic passive isn't great on a lot of champs. Has some potential on Udyr or Darius maybe but there are likely better choices for them.
   * **Goredrinker**(Mythic - 5 ability haste) - Active similar to current rav hydra, but directly heals you 20%ad + 12% missing health for each champion hit. The potential heal is _insane_ but should not be expected, also gives extra ad for missing health. Could be good for engage champions or tryndamere. Overall feels lower on tierlist
   * **Chempunk Chainsword**() - Grievous item for bruisers that dont want to build bramble, good to sit on executioners but not an item that you would complete early.
   * **Guardians Angel**() - Only change is that it gives back mana on respawn now.
   * **Silvermere Dawn**(Quicksilver) - This is a qss item that has health and both resists for stats, I dont see who would build this as someone who wants resists will likely survive being hit with cc. So maybe this is for engagey champions like Amumu or a tank that wants to get out of Mord ult. Weird niche item
   * **Maw of Malmortius**(Lifeline) - Similar stats to current maw but the passive is just a shield not the extra lifesteal portion and the sheild scales off of max HP. More usable for bruisers than current now imo.
   * **Death's Dance**() - No lifesteal on it, and only absorbs physical dmg. On kill cleanses bleed, and restores 10% hp over 2s. Good item, feels like they tried to make it more of a physical maw, but it is stronger. I feel like this item will be built often on bruisers.
   * **Ravenous/Titanic**(Hydra) - Similar to current, no active on either and Hydra has omnivamp on it. Similar power to current due to that.
   * **Black Cleaver**() - More expensive, gives less health and no movespeed passive, so before fully stacked it is weaker, but if you can get it stacked it does 5% missing health dmg each physical dmg hit. Really really strong on people who can stack this quickly(Riven, Darius come to mind)
   * **Wit's End**() - AD + AtSpd + MR, no lifesteal on it and now has movespeed passive. Feels like an irelia/jax item vs an ap top.
   * **Blade of the Ruined King BORK**() - No active, changed to 3hit to proc with 20s cd. Build on champions that do not have an issue with chasing like irela/jax and ranged champs. Champions like idk bruiser shyv, udyr, even master yi maybe like this item less, but if you can reliably get the three hit it feels stronger.
   * **Sterak's Gage**(Lifeline) - Same sheild as before but taking or dealing dmg heals you for % of your hp over time. Makes you really durable in teamfights and gives you pesudo lifesteal which is nice.
   * Example builds: 
     * Irelia(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Merc treads, BORK, Death's Dance) She gets a lot of AtSpd for free now, so bork/wits might not be necessary.
     * Voli(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Death's Dance -> Tank) Sunderer feels really good because of the mixed pen. Lots of potential builds for the bear.
     * Camille(Trinity/Goredrinker/Divine(?), Hydra item, DD) Trinity is just really good idk lol
     * Renekton(Goredrinker/Trinity, Black Cleaver, BORK) Flexible depending on how healthy you want to be
     * Sett(Stride Breaker, Dead Man's Plate, Force of Nature) The movespeed he gets from this build is really nice for lining up his ults and pulls.
### _AP Bruiser:_ 
   I think AP bruiser will be a combo of Mage itemization and Tank items so there is only one item here.
   * **Demonic Embrace**() - Magic damage starts a 1.5% maxhp burn as well as 10armor/mr + 2.5 for every additional champ affected. This item is good on like Mord only, don't listen to people who want to build this + liandries.
### _Tank:_ 
  Right so tank items kinda suck butt so I can see a lot of tanks poaching bruiser/mage items to become more effective. There are 3 main tank mythics and 2 supporty tank items which I will go over under the support itemization. All 3 tank mythics have the current sunfire passive. They also took out a lot of mana from tank items so its hard to find mana for tanks anymore.
  * **Sunfire Aegis**(Mythic - 5 Ability Haste) - Immolate passive that has stacking dmg in combat, at max stacks autoattacks add the immolate dmg. This is the best general tank mythic as the damage it adds for free is so important. Anyone that can stick on people should take this.
  * **Frostfire Guantlet**(Mythic - 100 Health + 7.5% Size) - Current iceborn passive but it applies on any autoattack with a 4s cd. This is armor focused mythic and it is nice that it doesnt have mana on it so it opens it up to non mana users. Rejoice that iceborn ez is now dead :crab:
  * **Turbo Chemtank**(Mythic - 5% Tenacity) - Basically righteous glory that is magic resist focused. Fine item but really underwhelming as a mythic probably better to choose a diffrent mythic that suits your needs better.
  * **Abyssal Mask**() - No mana on it, hard cc increases dmg to target by 10% for 4s. Decent engage tank item, land a big ult and everyone takes more dmg.
  * **Thornmail**() - Same use cases as before, has more health on it so it feels a little less bad to build it in general.
  * **Frozen Heart**(Rock Solid) - Same as before but has this new 'rock solid' passive on it which has a flat reduction of auto attack dmg based on your hp. This and randuins are good against auto based champions. With this being for fighting more attack speed carries.
  * **Randuins Omen**(Rock Solid) - Has a new active which slows and reduces crit dmg taken for 4s. Pretty much just for crit carries but you are only tanky for 4s. Deal with adc in 4s or you die.
  * **Spirits Visage**() - Hyper nerfed costs more gives less health and mr, the only upside is that **it works with shields now** so it can open up to people like shen building it, but now feels a bit more situational.
  * **Dead Man's Plate**() - Same
  * **Warmog's Armor**() - Same
  * **Force of Nature**() - Magic resist item, has passive of getting hit stacks mr and movespeed up to 5 times. Nice for people like singed and mundo feels like a pretty bad item though. 
  * **Gargoyle Stoneplate**() - You have to build this later as its passive gives you more armor + mr based on %armor/mr, new active gives a flat sheild based on health. Not a single uber tank item anymore. This is a 3rd or 4th build item.
  * Example builds:
    * Shen(Sunfire Aegis, Titanic, Visage, Armor item) - Visage would assist passive shield and ult shield.
    * Amumu(Sunfire Aegis/Turbo Chemtank, Abyssal, Armor, Gargoyles) - Chemtank could help him engage better and abyssal just makes it so after ult entire team does more dmg.
    * Ornn(Sunfire Aegis/Frostfire Guantlet, Abyssal, Armor, Gargoyles) - They just buffed sunfire with these mythics and they were already 90% of the time built on ornn so he feels pretty good.
     
## Jungle: 
  Jungle starting item now does not build into anything and its stats gets absorbed after using smite 5 times. This means that junglers are no longer locked to a jungle item and can freely dip into any class of items. The downside is that jungle items of the past were super efficient items that are cheaper than equivalent laning items, so they could be lagging behind in power from the laners even more. I had not played many jungle games so I can't really say much for specific jungle builds here though I imagine that they will be similar to laning builds for the most part. Just search for the class of champion you want to play and look at the items under that category.

## Mid:
### _AD Assassins:_
  Overall a lot of the assassin itemization is around the same as current itemization with a few exceptions and I will go over them below.
  * **Duskblade of Traktharr**(Mythic - 5 Ablility Haste) - Attacking a champ deals 75+30% bonus ad dmg on a 15s cd. Also if a champ you have dmg within 3s dies, you go invis and the cooldown is refreshed. Now before you insta think this is the best item let me tell you that out of the three assassin mythics this does the least dmg. It is a really good snowball item but not a must buy every game.
  * **Eclipse**(Mythic - 4% Armor Pen) - Hitting a champion twice deals 8% max health, gives you 30% movespeed and gives you 150+40%bonus ad shield. This item is nuts for champions that can weave in and out of combat to apply it throughout the fight. It has a 6s cd for melee and a 12s cd for ranged, but ranged champions can still utilize this really well. This is a good overall assassin mythic that could be a most games buy item for some champions.
  * **Prowler's Claw**(Mythic - 5 Lethality) - Active to dash through target enemy (talon q range that also follows dashes/flashes) and deals 100 + 30%bonus ad dmg and finally lets you deal 15% more dmg to target for 3 seconds. This is the item that you want to buy if you absolutely need to kill a target on the enemy team. The dash as well as the increased damage on mark is invaluable so the pure dmg helps you assassinate a single target so much more than either other mythic.
  * **Umbral Glaive**() - Essentially same as current but with more haste on it.
  * **Serpent's Fang**() - New lethality item that deals extra flat dmg to shields. I don't know how good this item is, I would say that if they only have one shield on their team this is likely not worth it. Though it could help with ADCs building immortal shieldbow. 
  * **Edge of Night**() - Same
  * **Youmuu's Ghostblade**() - Same with no haste on it
  * **Sanguine Blade**() - Same but gives physical vamp rather than lifesteal now so a bit better for casting assassins
  * **The Collector**() - This is a very strange item, combining the components into this item actually makes you lose 5ad but its passive is that if a target would be left under 5% hp it executes them. Again before you build this every game 5% of 2000 hp is 100hp so this is actually better for tankier targets. It also having crit on it somewhat limits who can build this effectively.
  * **Serylda's Grudge**(Last Whisper) - More of an ad caster item, somewhat of an AD rylais. I'm not sure who builds this yet, but could be an interesting item.
### _AP Assassins:_
  Generally AP Assassins are going to take one of three mythics and then mage items so this section will only be the Mythics and the rest of the AP items will be covered under the mage category. Also note that a lot of mages won't take these mythics because they do not have any mana on them so they run oom really quickly.
  * **Hextech Rocketbelt**(Mythic - 5 Magic Pen) - Same as current protobelt but it also gives movespeed towards enemy champs for 2s after using it. This is a really nice item because of the magic pen passive it has, there is only one other way to get magic pen in items and that is boots. The mobility is nice so a lot of the champs that built this before will still build this despite the increased price.
  * **Riftmaker**(Mythic - 5% Magic Pen) - This feels like it would be a AP Bruiser item though I think this can be taken on a lot of different champs that can stay in the fight. It gives you increased dmg for how long you are in the fight up to 15% and once its at 15% the bonus dmg is true dmg it also has omnivamp on it. This feels like a Vlad/Akali item and _maybe_ for bruisers against a tank. The % pen and omnivamp feels really nice on pretty much anyone that can build this.
  * **Night Harvester**(Mythic - 5 Ability Haste) - Hitting a champ deals bonus dmg and gives you movespeed with a 40s cd per champion. This feels more like a traditional assassin item. The bonus dmg upfront helps with burst and the movespeed helps chase or get out after bursting. 
### _Mages:_
  Honestly most of these items are pretty ResidentSleeper to me as they are very similar to the current selection of mage items. There are some interesting new choices for artillery mages and kiting mages but less mana options overall.
  * **Liandry's Anguish**(Mythic - 5 Ability Haste) - This item now has an ap scaling on the %max health burn and shreds magic resist. It puts a lot of pressure on high hp targets over the course of the fight and is really obnoxious for any target you hit. The burn can kill and for some reason burns through shields, as in it does not do dmg to shields and will still hit your main hp. Really nuts item if you can constantly apply it and also want the haste that it gives.
  * **Luden's Tempest**(Mythic - 5 Magic Pen) - Now it still has the extra dmg splash it has a flat 10s cd and gives 30% movespeed for 2s. This is strictly a better version of the current Luden's and with magic pen in its final item as well as its passive means that it is really strong against squishy targets.
  * **Everfrost**(Mythic - 15 AP) - Active for slowing bolts in a cone, targets in the center get _rooted_ for 1.5s with a 20s cd. The active is so amazing, champs like sylas love this item. He is able to get on them and hit the root for free extra cc in his kit. This with the fact that it is on a 20s cd is nuts, so you want to build this with anyone that can already lock someone down to land the root in succession.
  * **Mejai's Soulstealer**() - Same
  * **Banshee's Veil**() - Same
  * **Void Staff**() - Same _but_ it has a component with magic pen on it so you feel the pen without finishing the full item which makes building into this feel better.
  * **Zhonya's Hourglass**() - Same
  * **Morellonomicon**() - Same with some changes. The grievous effect is stronger when the target is below 50% hp, so it helps let you finish off targets. Also its build component has grievous on it so you can just sit on the component if needed.
  * **Archangel's Staff**(Mana Stack) - Same but no active so you do not get the sheild anymore and no haste, but you get more AP from its passive. Note: Tear is different but I will go over that in the starting items section.
  * **Lich Bane**() - No longer has mana or haste on it. No mana opens this item up to more champions without feeling like you are wasting gold in stats.
  * **Nashor's Tooth**() - More ap, no haste. No haste hurts champions like azir building this but honestly this item feels like it was build for kai'sa. 100 AP to give her evolve off of one item and the haste was somewhat a wasted stat on her.
  * **Rylai's Crystal Scepter**() - Same
  * **Horizon Focus**() - New item where damaging a champion with a skillshot from over 750 range or hard ccing them reveals them and increases your dmg to them by 10% for 6s. This feels like a must build for high range mages as it pretty much just gives you a flat 10% dmg increase. Xerath, Ziggs, Zoe, even Syndra could use this.
  * **Cosmic Drive**() - Basically like an AP phage item, dmging a champ gives you movespeed based on current ability haste. I could see kiting champs like cass or ryze using this potentially.
  * **Rabadon's Deathcap**() - Same as before but it is now the most expensive item in the game by a long shot at 3800g. Hard to invest into but you get that raw AP.
