### Notes:
- Use [this site](https://lolshop.gg/) to look at the full item list

- Items with parenthesis are the unique keywords (meaning you cannot build two items with the same keywords)

- Mythic items will have their mythic passive stat next to them, each completed item minus the mythic itself  and boots
  will give that stat.

- Ability haste is the percent more spells that you can cast, 100 haste means you can cast your ability 100% more times, twice as much\
  65 haste ~~ 40cdr\
  100 haste ~~ 50cdr\
  15 haste ~~ 13cdr

- Suggest champions/specific items to review to me(Ethoe)

## Top:
* _Bruisers:_ \
    There are a lot of items that give pseduo lifesteal in that they dont have the stat lifesteal, but gives back a lot of hp through passives. A lot of health items not a lot of great items for resists.
    * **Trinity**(Mythic - 10 Attack Speed) - Gives spellblade and in champion combat base AD: Really good for champions that can utilize attack Speed
    * **Divine Sunderer**(Mythic - 5% armor + mr pen) - Spellblade passive that does %max hp dmg and heals you for a percent ofthat dmg: Insane item, the mythic passive gives both pen so champions like Jax can use it really well against tanks.
    * **Stride Breaker**(Mythic - 3% movespeed) - Active to dash a short distance for 110% ad dmg + 60% slow: Underwhelming item, the dash is really short and the mythic passive isn't great on a lot of champs. Has some potential on Udyr or Darius maybe but there are likely better choices for them.
    * **Goredrinker**(Mythic - 5 ability haste) - Active similar to current rav hydra, but directly heals you 20%ad + 12% missing health for each champion hit. The potential heal is _insane_ but should not be expected, also gives extra ad for missing health. Could be good for engage champions or tryndamere. Overall feels lower on tierlist
    * **Chempunk Chainsword**() - Grievous item for bruisers that dont want to build bramble, good to sit on executioners but not an item that you would complete early.
    * **Guardians Angel**() - Only change is that it gives back mana on respawn now.
    * **Silvermere Dawn**(Quicksilver) - This is a qss item that has health and both resists for stats, I dont see who would build this as someone who wants resists will likely survive being hit with cc. So maybe this is for engagey champions like Amumu or a tank that wants to get out of Mord ult. Weird niche item
    * **Maw of Malmortius**(Lifeline) - Similar stats to current maw but the passive is just a shield not the extra lifesteal portion and the sheild scales off of max HP. More usable for bruisers than current now imo.
    * **Death's Dance**() - No lifesteal on it, and only absorbs physical dmg. On kill cleanses bleed, and restores 10% hp over 2s. Good item, feels like they tried to make it more of a physical maw, but it is stronger. I feel like this item will be built often on bruisers.
    * **Ravenous/Titanic**(Hydra) - Similar to current, no active on either and Hydra has omnivamp on it. Similar power to current due to that.
    * **Black Cleaver**() - More expensive, gives less health and no movespeed passive, so before fully stacked it is weaker, but if you can get it stacked it does 5% missing health dmg each physical dmg hit. Really really strong on people who can stack this quickly(Riven, Darius come to mind)
    * **Wit's End**() - AD + AtSpd + MR, no lifesteal on it and now has movespeed passive. Feels like an irelia/jax item vs an ap top.
    * **Blade of the Ruined King BORK**() - No active, changed to 3hit to proc with 20s cd. Build on champions that do not have an issue with chasing like irela/jax and ranged champs. Champions like idk bruiser shyv, udyr, even master yi maybe like this item less, but if you can reliably get the three hit it feels stronger.
    * Example builds: 
      * Irelia(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Merc treads, BORK, Death's Dance) She gets a lot of AtSpd for free now, so bork/wits might not be necessary.
      * Voli(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Death's Dance -> Tank) Sunderer feels really good because of the mixed pen. Lots of potential builds for the bear.
      * Camille(Trinity/Goredrinker/Divine(?), Hydra item, DD) Trinity is just really good idk lol
      * Renekton(Goredrinker/Trinity, Black Cleaver, BORK) Flexible depending on how healthy you want to be
 * _AP Bruiser:_ \
    I think AP bruiser will be a combo of Mage itemization and Tank items so there is only one item here.
    * **Demonic Embrace**() - Magic damage starts a 1.5% maxhp burn as well as 10armor/mr + 2.5 for every additional champ affected. This item is good on like Mord only, don't listen to people who want to build this + liandries.
 * _Tank:_ \
  Right so tank items kinda suck butt so I can see a lot of tanks poaching bruiser/mage items to become more effective. There are 3 main tank mythics and 2 supporty tank items which I will go over under the support itemization. All 3 tank mythics have the current sunfire passive.
  * **Sunfire Aegis**(Mythic - 5 Ability Haste) - Immolate passive that has stacking dmg in combat, at max stacks autoattacks add the immolate dmg. This is the best general tank mythic as the damage it adds for free is so important. Anyone that can stick on people should take this.
  * **Frostfire Guantlet**(Mythic - 100 Health + 7.5% Size) - Current iceborn passive but it applies on any autoattack with a 4s cd. This is armor focused mythic and it is nice that it doesnt have mana on it so it opens it up to non mana users. Rejoice that iceborn ez is now dead :crab:
  * **Turbo Chemtank**(Mythic - 5% Tenacity) - Basically righteous glory that is magic resist focused. Fine item but really underwhelming as a mythic probably better to choose a diffrent mythic that suits your needs better.
