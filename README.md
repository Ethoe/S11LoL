### Notes
- Items with parenthesis are the unique keywords (meaning you cannot build two items with the same keywords)

- Mythic items will have their mythic passive stat next to them, each completed item minus the mythic itself  and boots
  will give that stat.

- Ability haste is the precent more spells that you can cast, 100 haste means you can cast your ability 100% more times, twice as much\
  65 haste ~~ 40cdr\
  100 haste ~~ 50cdr\
  15 haste ~~ 13cdr

- Suggest champions/specific items to me

## Top:
* Bruisers: \
    There are a lot of items that give pseduo lifesteal in that they dont have the stat lifesteal, but gives back a lot of hp through passives. A lot of health items not a lot of great items for resists.
    * **Trinity**(Mythic - 10 Attack Speed) - Gives spellblade and in champion combat base AD: Really good for champions that can utilize attack Speed
    * **Divine Sunderer**(Mythic - 5% armor + mr pen) - Spellblade passive that does %max hp dmg and heals you for a percent ofthat dmg: Insane item, the mythic passive gives both pen so champions like Jax can use it really well against tanks.
    * **Stride Breaker**(Mythic - 3% movespeed) - Active to dash a short distance for 110% ad dmg + 60% slow: Underwhelming item, the dash is really short and the mythic passive isn't great on a lot of champs. Has some potential on Udyr or Darius maybe but there are likely better choices for them.
    * **Goredrinker**(Mythic - 5 ability haste) - Active similar to current rav hydra, but directly heals you 20%ad + 12% missing health for each champion hit. The potential heal is _insane_ but should not be expected, also gives extra ad for missing health. Could be good for engage champions or tryndamere. Overall feels lower on tierlist
    * **Chempunk Chainsword**() - Grievous item for bruisers that dont want to build bramble, good to sit on executioners but not an item that you would complete early.
    * **Guardians Angel**() - Only change is that it gives back mana on respawn now.
    * **Silvermere Dawn**(Quicksilver) - This is a qss item that has health and both resists for stats, I dont see who would build this as someone who wants resists will likely survive being hit with cc. So maybe this is for engagey champions like Amumu or a tank that wants to get out of Mord ult. Weird niche item
    * **Maw of Malmortius**(Lifeline) - Similar stats to current maw but the passive is just a shield not the extra lifesteal portion and the sheild scales off of max HP. More usable for bruisers than current now imo.
    * **Death's Dance**() - No lifesteal on it, and only absorbs physical dmg. On kill cleanses bleed, and restores 10% hp over 2s. Good item, feels like they tried to make it more of a physical maw, but it is stronger. I feel like this item will be built often on bruisers.
    * **Ravenous/Titanic**(Hydra) - Similar to current, no active on either and Hydra has omnivamp on it. Similar power to current due to that.
    * **Black Cleaver**() - More expensive, gives less health and no movespeed passive, so before fully stacked it is weaker, but if you can get it stacked it does 5% missing health dmg each physical dmg hit. Really really strong on people who can stack this quickly(Riven, Darius come to mind)
    * **Wit's End**() - AD + AtSpd + MR, no lifesteal on it and now has movespeed passive. Feels like an irelia/jax item vs an ap top.
    * **Blade of the Ruined King BORK**() - No active, changed to 3hit to proc with 20s cd. Build on champions that do not have an issue with chasing like irela/jax and ranged champs. Champions like idk bruiser shyv, udyr, even master yi maybe like this item less, but if you can reliably get the three hit it feels stronger.
    * Example builds: 
      * Irelia(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Merc treads, BORK, Death's Dance) She gets a lot of AtSpd for free now, so bork/wits might not be necessary.
      * Voli(Trinity/Divine Sunderer, Death's Dance -> Tank) Sunderer feels really good because of the mixed pen. Lots of potential builds for the bear.
      * Camille(Trinity/Goredrinker/Divine(?), Hydra item, DD) Trinity is just really good idk lol
      * Renekton(Goredrinker/Trinity, Black Cleaver, BORK) Flexible depending on how healthy you want to be
